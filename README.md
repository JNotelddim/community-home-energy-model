# Community Home Energy Model Kit

This repository is a quick-and-dirty project built over the course of a few days
as part of the inaugural run of the [Software Stacks in Climate Tech](https://terra.do/climate-education/cohort-courses/software-stacks-in-climate-tech/)
Course by Terra.do .

Amy Yang and Nick Keenan welcomed me (Jared McKimm) into their project for the course.
[TODO: links to profiles?]

The concept here is a sort of a:
"Climate lunchbox toolkit for Residential communities to identify potential improvements they can enact."

(NOTE, large portions of this codebase consist of code copied from the lab in the course where simple energy modeling
code for a home was made available to us as a Hex notebook.)

## How it works:

TBD

```
python3 src/main.py
```
